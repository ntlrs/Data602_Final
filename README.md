Overview:
There are currently 191 cryptocurrency exchanges throughout the world. Cryptocurrency markets lack the unified infrastructure of more advanced markets that supports this kind of complex trading.  

The large number of exchange choices presents a multitude of problems, since they are unregulated and and disjoined, including a large distribution of prices across the multiple platforms. This presents an opportunity for arbitrage with the different exchanges. 

Proposal:
Our proposal is to explore the bid and ask prices of some of the top cryptocurrencies among the Binance, Poloniex, and Bitfinex exchanges and try to find negative spread. If we are able to find a negative spread we can explore what a possible profit one might make from buying on one exchange and selling on another. The result of our project will be a script that compares current prices of cryptocurrencies and if it finds an opportunity for arbitrage, 

Data Sources:
We will be focusing on the top 3 exchanges to look for arbitrage opportunities:

Poloniex.com
Binance.com
Bitfinex.com

We will be looking at trading pairs that are traded between these three exchanges.

Risks:
Trades need to be as close to real time as possible.
Rest API call rates can limit our actions
Fees might minimize profit on the exchange
The volatility of coin prices
